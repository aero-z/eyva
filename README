EYVA 0.1
========
Readme file


Introduction:

    `eyva' is an attempt to create a `Rogue'-like game for the CLI.


Requirements:

    * ncurses


Build:

    Run `make' in the project's root directory. This will create server and
    client binaries. Options are:

    * eserver: This will compile the server component.
    * eclient: This will compile the client component.
    * all:     This will build the client and server component [default].
    * keymap:  This will compile a helper program to find out values
               corresponding to a key. It can be stopped by hitting 'c'.
    * clean:   This will remove all object files in the source directories.
    * purge:   This will remove all object files in the source directories and
               built binaries.
   

Execute:
   
    * `eserver' will listen to port 1251. You may use `netcat' to send and
      receive data. The server can be stopped by sending ":q\n".
    * `eclient' is currently just a UI without any functionality. It can be
      stopped by the command ":q".
