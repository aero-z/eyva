EYVA 0.1d2
==========
Readme file


Introduction:

   eyva is a "Rogue"-like game for the CLI.
   It's basically a proof-of-concept, playground and still in development, so
   don't expect it to do a lot.

   eyva consists of a server component and a client component.
   Both components are independent programs.

   This means you may decide to either play eyva as a single-player (by
   starting both the client and the server on your local machine) or together
   with other players (by starting the client on your local machine and
   connecting to a remote (or locale) shared server).


Compile:

   +---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | ATTENTION:                                                                |
   | This version of the code does not properly run. The last version that     |
   | "worked" is placed in /hist.                                              |
   +---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

   This aplies to both the server and the client:
   cd into the /-directory; you should now see a `Makefile'.
   Next, run `make'. This will compile the program and create an executable
   binary.
   

Run:
   
   It doesn't do anything yet.
   But it's supposed to work like this:

   First start the server by running the executable. It will print a message and
   indicate what port it is listening to.
   Next, start the client as follows:

   +---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | EyvaClient -h [ip_address] -p [port_number]                               |
   +---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

   You may also use `localhost' instead of the IP address of the local machine.

   You may either run the server in the background and run the client in the
   same terminal, or you may start the server and the client in two different
   terminals. The later might be useful if you want to see the server's log
   messages. See the server's README file for further information.
