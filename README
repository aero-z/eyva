EYVA 0.1d2
==========
Readme file


Introduction:

   `eyva' is an attempt to create a `Rogue'-like game for the CLI.
   It's basically a proof-of-concept, playground and still in development, so
   don't expect it to do a lot.

   `eyva' consists of a server component and a client component.
   Both components are independent programs.

   This means you may decide to either play `eyva' as a single-player (by
   starting both the client and the server on your local machine) or together
   with other players (by starting the client on your local machine and
   connecting to a remote (or local) shared server).


Compile:

   Run `make' in the project's root directory. This will create server and
   client binaries.
   

Run:
   
   It doesn't do anything yet.
   You may execute the `EyvaServer', which will listen to port 1251, and use
   netcat to send and receive data.
   `EyvaClient' is currently under heavy development and won't do anything
   useful.
