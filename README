EYVA 0.1
========
Readme file


Introduction:

    `eyva' is an attempt to create a `Rogue'-like game for the CLI.
    It's basically a proof-of-concept, playground, and still in development, so
    don't expect it to do a lot.

    `eyva' consists of a server component and a client component.
    Both components are independent programs.

    This means you may decide to either play `eyva' as a single-player (by
    starting both the client and the server on your local machine) or together
    with other players (by starting the client on your local machine and
    connecting to a remote (or local) shared server).


Requirements:

    * ncurses


Compile:

    Run `make' in the project's root directory. This will create server and
    client binaries.
   

Execute:
   
    * `eserver' will listen to port 1251. You may use `netcat' to send and
      receive data.
    * `eclient' is currently just a UI without any functionality. It can be
      stopped by the command ":q".
