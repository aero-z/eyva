EYVA 0.1
========
Readme file


Introduction:

    EYVA is an attempt to create a network-capable role playing game in 2D.


Requirements:

    * SDL


Build:

    Run make in the project's root directory. This will create server and client
    binaries.


Execute:
   
    'eserver' will listen to port 1251. You may use netcat to send and
    receive data. The server stops when receiving the byte sequence [:][q][\n].

    'eclient' doesn't do anything.


Bugs:

    Please report bugs to the project site:
