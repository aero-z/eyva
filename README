EYVA 0.1
========
Readme file


Introduction:

   `eyva' is an attempt to create a `Rogue'-like game for the CLI.
   It's basically a proof-of-concept, playground, and still in development, so
   don't expect it to do a lot.

   `eyva' consists of a server component and a client component.
   Both components are independent programs.

   This means you may decide to either play `eyva' as a single-player (by
   starting both the client and the server on your local machine) or together
   with other players (by starting the client on your local machine and
   connecting to a remote (or local) shared server).


Requirements:

   * ncurses
   * OS:
     - GNU/Linux (tested on Arch Linux)
     - Mac OS X (see issue #4 for troubleshooting)


Compile:

   Run `make' in the project's root directory. This will create server and
   client binaries.
   

Execute:
   
   Currently, the components have no real functionality:
   
   `eserver' will listen to port 1251. You may use `netcat' to send and receive
   data.

   `eclient' will just connect to the default IP and port where the server is
   supposed to run, send nothing, and display messages until killed.
