Map terrain values definition


Purpose:

    This file serves as an information base for terrain values found in map
    files.

    Some terrain types specify a terrain object that does not define the ground.
    In such case, the object may be assumed to be placed upon one of the
    following ground types:

     * GRASS
     * SAND
     * SHALLOW_WATER
     * DEEP_WATER

    where it will get the ground type that occurs the most in the 8 fields next
    to the object itself.
    In case of draw, the type will become the first one of the list above.

    Example:
    If for example there's a tree surrounded by 2 grass fields, 3 sand
    fields and 3 shallow water fields, the type of the ground underneath the
    tree will become "sand").


Miscellaneous information:

    Lines 21 and further define the effects that trigger on entering the field.
    Each line corresponds to a number appearing in the map.


Keytable:

 0  '?' VOID
        Accessible field that contains nothing. Its purpose is to fill the
        undefined fields in a map that is not of dimension 40x20.
        It may also represent a hole, so if a character enters a void field, it
        will automatically be dropped to the next lower terrain level.

        accessed without ability to swim.

 4  'W' DEEP_WATER
        Limitedly accessible field that represents a deep water field. It can be
        accessed only with ability to swim. It causes exhaution at the character
        for each step taken in that field.
